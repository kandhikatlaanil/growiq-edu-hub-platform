            <p className="text-lg md:text-xl opacity-90">
              When most people hear "School ERP" or "School Management Software," they usually think of it as a tool for just reporting and maintaining records. But that's an old-school way of thinking. In today's fast-paced world, a school needs much more than just reporting ‚Äì it needs an efficient, automated, and intelligent system that not only saves time but also boosts productivity and streamlines everyday operations.
